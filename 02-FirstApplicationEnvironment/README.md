# First Application Environment

For this activity we want to find a simple way to demostrate how to containerize an application you develop or use which has a set of dependencies.  Lets build a docker which helps with this.

## Requirements

# Runs a given cannonical base image like Ubuntu 16.04
# Installs some set of dependencies on top of the base image
# Runs an application in this environment
