# First Application Environment

For this activity we want to find a simple way to demostrate how to containerize an application you develop or use which has a set of dependencies.  Lets build a docker which helps with this.

## Requirements

* Runs a given cannonical base image like Ubuntu 16.04
* Installs some set of dependencies on top of the base image for the language of your choice
* Executes a unit test in language of your choice inside the docker and prints out the results
